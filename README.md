# Particle Playground
A powder toy-like game written in Pygame.

## Philosophy

Particle Playground is built on three core principles that guide its development and community:

1. **Freedom and Public Domain Dedication**:
   - **Unrestricted Access**: We are committed to the principles of free and libre software. By dedicating Particle Playground to the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license, we empower everyone to use, modify, and distribute the game without any limitations. This approach fosters creativity, collaboration, and the open sharing of knowledge.
   - **Fallback Licensing**: For additional legal clarity and protection, we offer a fallback to the Apache 2.0 license. This ensures that while the project remains freely accessible, it also includes necessary legal safeguards and protections.

2. **Realistic Simulations**:
   - **Authentic Physics**: Our aim is to create simulations that are as realistic as possible, providing accurate representations of physical phenomena. This focus on realism enhances the educational value of the game and delivers a more immersive and believable experience for players.
   - **Continuous Refinement**: We are dedicated to the ongoing improvement of our simulations. By incorporating feedback from the community and staying current with scientific advancements, we strive to make Particle Playground a continuously evolving and increasingly accurate representation of the real world.

3. **Modular and Extensible Design**:
   - **Easy Customization**: Designed with modularity and extensibility at its core, Particle Playground allows for the easy addition of new features, elements, and behaviors. This makes it simple for users to customize and extend the game to fit their own creative visions.
   - **Encouraging Innovation**: By providing a flexible and easily modifiable framework, we encourage users to experiment and innovate. Whether you're adding new elements, tweaking existing mechanics, or creating entirely new gameplay experiences, Particle Playground serves as a fertile ground for creativity and development.
